# Open Switch Simulator project

This project simulates **SNMP agent** for sending traps and managing snmpwalk requests. It could be deployed using Docker. There are following components:

- Switch Simulator UI (web client)
- Mock SNMP agent (Spring Boot)

Docker image is published here:

[Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/swarm/skochetkov/repository/docker/skochetkov/switch-sim-spring-boot-docker/general)

You can run it:
```console
$ docker run -e OPENNMSSERVER_ADDRESS='123.123.123.123' OPENNMSSERVER_AGENTPORT=161 OPENNMSSERVER_CARDS=4 OPENNMSSERVER_PORTS=8 -p 8080:8080  -t skochetkov/switch-sim-spring-boot-docker
```
*Notes:*

OPENNMSSERVER_CARDS specifies a number of switch cards on SNMP agent

OPENNMSSERVER_PORTS specifies a number of ports **per** card

Just replace OPENNMSSERVER_ADDRESS argument value with your openNMS server host ip
